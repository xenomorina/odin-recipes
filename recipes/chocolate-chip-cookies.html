    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground flaxseed</li>
        <li>2.5 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegan butter, slightly softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups brown sugar, lightly packed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups non-dairy chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.</li>
        <li>Mix the ground flaxseed and water in a small bowl and set aside to make your flax egg.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the softened vegan butter and brown sugar for 1-2 minutes until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla and the flax egg and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Next, stop the mixer and add the flour. Sprinkle the cornstarch, baking soda and salt on top of the flour. Turn the mixer on low speed, and mix until just combined. </li>
        <li>Add in the chocolate chips to incorporate, either by hand or using the mixer.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into balls, about 1-2 tablespoons each. Place on the prepared pans and bake for 10 minutes (12 minutes for larger cookies), until they are barely golden around the edges. <strong>Do not over bake!</strong> They will be puffy and lightly colored.</li>
        <li>Let cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. The cookies will firm up as they cool, and become the most perfect chewy cookies ever! Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
