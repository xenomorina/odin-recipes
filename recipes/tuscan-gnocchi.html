    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>One pan Tuscan Vegan Gnocchi features pillowy soft gnocchi, a flavorful creamy sauce, garlic, vegan sausage, fresh spinach and sun dried tomatoes. A fancy dinner ready in 20 minutes!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 vegan Italian sausages (7-8 ounces), sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable broth</li>
        <li>13.5 ounce can full fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes, sliced if whole</li>
        <li>1 pound uncooked gnocchi (the dry packaged kind)</li>
        <li>salt + pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups loosely packed baby spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Vegan Parmesan, + more for garnish, optional</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, saut√© the vegan sausage in the olive oil over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the vegetable broth, coconut milk, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, sun-dried tomatoes and gnocchi. Give everything a good stir.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then lower heat to medium and cook, uncovered for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add salt + pepper to taste, and stir in the spinach. Cook for another 2 minutes, until the spinach has wilted.</li>
        <li>If using, stir in the vegan parmesan. At this point, the gnocchi should be cooked through but not mushy, and the sauce thickened somewhat. Cook an additional minute or two if necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately garnished with vegan parmesan and fresh basil. Enjoy immediately for best results. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Add a little extra broth or water when re-heating, as the sauce will thicken as it cools. It can be frozen if needed.</li>
    </ol>
